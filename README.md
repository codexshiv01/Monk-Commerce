### 2. Product-wise Coupons

Apply discounts to specific products, categories, or brands.

#### Subtypes:
- **Specific Product Discount**: Discount on particular products
- **Category Discount**: Discount on all products in a category
- **Brand Discount**: Discount on all products from a specific brand
- **Multi-Product Discount**: Discount on a set of specified products

#### Examples:

### 3. BxGy (Buy X Get Y) Coupons

Complex offers where purchasing certain products gives free or discounted items.

#### Features:

## ‚úÖ Advanced Features Implemented

### üéØ **Advanced Coupon Types**

#### 1. **Coupon Stacking** ‚úÖ
- **Feature**: Apply multiple coupons simultaneously with priority resolution
- **How it works**: 
  - Coupons can be marked as `stackable: true`
  - Priority system determines optimal combinations
  - Algorithm compares single high-value vs. multiple stacked coupons
- **Usage**: Set `allowStacking: true` in API requests
- **Test**: Use codes `STACK10` + `STACKSHIP` together

#### 2. **Tiered Discounts** ‚úÖ
- **Feature**: Progressive discounts based on cart value
- **Example**: 5% off $100+, 10% off $300+, 15% off $500+
- **How it works**: 
  - Multiple tier definitions with minimum thresholds
  - Automatic selection of highest qualifying tier
  - Max discount caps per tier
- **Test**: Use code `TIERED2024` with different cart values

#### 3. **Flash Sales** ‚úÖ
- **Feature**: Time-based discounts with specific active windows
- **How it works**:
  - Define time windows (hour ranges, days of week)
  - Discount multipliers for flash periods
  - Real-time validation of active status
- **Test**: Use code `FLASHFRIDAY` (active Friday 6-8 PM)

#### 4. **User-Specific Coupons** ‚úÖ
- **Feature**: Coupons based on user characteristics and behavior
- **Criteria supported**:
  - First-time users (`isFirstTime: true`)
  - Loyalty levels with multipliers
  - Order count ranges
  - Registration age requirements
- **Test**: Use code `WELCOME50` with new user data

#### 5. **Graduated BxGy** ‚úÖ
- **Feature**: Increasing benefits with higher purchase quantities
- **Example**: Buy 2‚Üíget 1 free, Buy 4‚Üíget 3 free, Buy 6‚Üíget 5 free
- **How it works**:
  - Multiple tier rules with increasing benefits
  - Optimal tier selection based on cart contents
  - Repetition limits per tier
- **Test**: Use code `GRADUATE` with varying quantities

#### 6. **Cross-Category BxGy** ‚úÖ
- **Feature**: Buy from one category, get discount on another
- **Example**: Buy 2 Electronics ‚Üí 50% off Clothing
- **How it works**:
  - Category-based buy/get requirements
  - Flexible discount percentages (not just free)
  - Cross-category relationship validation
- **Test**: Use code `CROSSCAT` with mixed categories

#### 7. **Percentage BxGy** ‚úÖ
- **Feature**: Partial discounts instead of completely free items
- **Example**: Buy 2 laptops ‚Üí 50% off the third laptop
- **How it works**:
  - Configurable discount percentages (1-100%)
  - Works with all BxGy variants
  - Smart price-based sorting for maximum savings
- **Test**: Use code `BXGY50` for 50% discount

## üìù Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
1. **Single Currency**: All prices are in the same currency (no conversion needed)
2. **Synchronous Processing**: Coupon application is processed synchronously
3. **In-Memory Cart**: Cart data is provided with each request (no persistent cart storage)
4. **Product Catalog**: Products exist in the database with required fields (price, category, brand)
5. **No Authentication**: API endpoints are publicly accessible (should be secured in production)

### Business Logic Assumptions
1. **Single Coupon Application**: Only one coupon can be applied per cart at a time
2. **Immediate Discount**: Discounts are applied immediately without approval workflow
3. **No Coupon Abuse Prevention**: No advanced fraud detection for coupon misuse
4. **Static Product Prices**: Product prices don't change during coupon calculation
5. **No Tax Calculations**: Discounts are applied before tax considerations

### Data Assumptions
1. **Valid Product IDs**: All product IDs in requests exist in the database
2. **Positive Quantities**: All item quantities are positive integers
3. **Valid Dates**: Coupon start/end dates are properly formatted
4. **Unique Coupon Codes**: Coupon codes are unique across the system
5. **Stable Database**: Database operations are reliable and don't fail unexpectedly

### User Behavior Assumptions
1. **Honest Usage**: Users don't attempt to manipulate coupon system
2. **Valid Cart Data**: Cart items represent genuine purchase intent
3. **One-time Usage**: Each coupon application represents a unique transaction
4. **Real-time Processing**: Users expect immediate coupon validation results

## üß™ Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Models**: Comprehensive model validation and method testing
- **Services**: Business logic testing with various scenarios
- **Controllers**: API endpoint testing with integration tests
- **Error Handling**: Edge cases and error condition testing
